As you can see from the data above, vehicle weigh, spoiler angle, and AWD provide a non-random amount of variance to MPG.  In other words, these 3 variables have a signifcant impact on MPG.  We can see this from the Pr(>|t|) value which represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. 

The slope of our linear model is definitely not zero because our p-value: 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than our assumed level of significance of %.05.  Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

With a Multiple R-squared of 0.7149 you can gather that these 5 variables have a positive corralation to MPG.
